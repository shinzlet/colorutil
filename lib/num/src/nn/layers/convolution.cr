# In a CNN, the input is a `Tensor` with a shape:
#
# (# of inputs) x (input h) x (input w) x (input channels)
#
# After passing through a convolutional layer, the image becomes abstracted
# to a feature map, also called an activation map, with shape:
#
# (# of inputs) x (feature map h) x (feature map w) x (feature map channels)
#
# Convolutional layers convolve the input and pass its result to the next
# layer. This is similar to the response of a neuron in the visual cortex
# to a specific stimulus. Each convolutional neuron processes data
# only for its receptive field. Although fully connected feedforward neural
# networks can be used to learn features and classify data, this architecture
# is generally impractical for larger inputs such as high resolution images.
# It would require a very high number of neurons, even in a shallow
# architecture, due to the large input size of images, where each pixel
# is a relevant input feature. For instance, a fully connected layer for a
# (small) image of size 100 x 100 has 10,000 weights for each neuron in the
# second layer. Instead, convolution reduces the number of free parameters,
# allowing the network to be deeper. For example, regardless of image size,
# using a 5 x 5 tiling region, each with the same shared weights, requires
# only 25 learnable parameters. Using regularized weights over fewer
# parameters avoids the vanishing gradients and exploding gradients problems
# seen during backpropagation in traditional neural networks. Furthermore,
# convolutional neural networks are ideal for data with a grid-like topology
# (such as images) as spatial relations between separate features are taken
# into account during convolution and/or pooling.

  # ## Arguments
  #
  # * context : `Num::Grad::Context(T)` - Context of the network.  This argument
  #   is used entirely to determine the generic type of the layer
  # * in_shape : `Array(Int)` - Shape of input to layer
  # * num_filters : `Int` - Number of filters to apply in the convolution
  # * kernel_height : `Int` - Height of kernel for convolution
  # * kernel_width : `Int` - Width of kernel for convolution
  # * padding : `Int` - Padding of kernel
  # * stride : `Int` - Stride of kernel.
  #
  # NOTE: The `stride` argument is currently only supported for the
  # `im2colgemm_conv2d`, as it is not supported by NNPACK.  Using this
  # parameter is rarely worth the large performance difference if you
  # are able to use NNPACK
