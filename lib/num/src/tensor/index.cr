  # for this method is identical to the `[]` method.

  # If a `Tensor` is passed as the value to set, it will be broadcast
  # to the shape of the slice if possible.  If a scalar is passed, it will
  # be tiled across the slice.
  #
  # ## Arguments
  #
  # * args : `*U` - Tuple of arguments.  All but the last argument must be
  #   valid indexer, so a `Range`, `Int`, or `Tuple(Range, Int)`.  The final
  #   argument passed is used to set the values of the `Tensor`.  It can
  #   be either a `Tensor`, or a scalar value.
  #
  # ## Examples
  #
  # ```
  # a = Tensor.new([2, 2]) { |i| i }
  # a[1.., 1..] = 99
  # a
  #
  # # [[ 0,  1],
